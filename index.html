    <h3>Java Game: Fruit Ninja</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project is a java 2d game. It is a simple game of a ninja moving through the levels, avoiding the interference of the enemies to complete the game. There are certain parameters to move to the next level such as the ninja has to collect all the bananas in the level to advance to the next level. Each level get harder where the amount of enemies increases as you progress. The ninja has special weapons that can kill enemies to make it easier to  get pass the obstruction to complete the level. There are also other obstructions such as a lava which the ninja needs escape to avoid being killed.
